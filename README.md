# CMPT353Project


1. The datasets directory, containing 'full_data.csv' and 'muse_v3.csv' contains the datasets that we will be loading into our program
2. regression_Colab.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the setup of the environment, code to clean and analyze the data, and code to present the results
3. All other files in the repository are programs that we discarded in our final model.

# Running the Project
1. If running this project locally, run the cells below the ones containing the setup of the environment, i.e., all the cells in and under the section "Load Data".
2. If running this program on Google Colab (recommended), download "regression_Colab.ipynb" from our repository and open it in Google Colab. In Colab, create a directory called /datasets and download "/datasets/full_data.csv" and "/datasets/muse_v3.csv" from our repository and paste it into the directory named '/datasets' in your Colab environment. Run all the cells in the notebook in order to install the Conda environment and any necessary dependencies. Use the provided API key when prompted to login to wandb.
